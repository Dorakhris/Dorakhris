Welcome to My GitHub Repository!
Iâ€™m Dorathy Christopher, a cybersecurity specialist with hands-on experience in incident response, digital forensics, and Identity and Access Management (IAM). This repository is a reflection of my journey and expertise in the field of cybersecurity, showcasing my projects and skills.

Objective
Driven by my passion for security and the evolving landscape of the internet, Iâ€™m dedicated to a career in cybersecurity with a focus on digital forensics. I am currently preparing for the CompTIA Security+ SY0-701 exam while continually expanding my knowledge through practical projects and real-world scenarios. My goal is to apply my analytical skills and hands-on experience in incident response, digital forensics, and security audits to contribute to a dynamic cybersecurity team. I aim to help protect organizations by developing and implementing security frameworks, conducting thorough vulnerability assessments, and analyzing cyber threats to align with business objectives.
